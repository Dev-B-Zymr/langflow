Connect your Langflow server to NVIDIA R2X to make a flow available to your digital avatar as a tool.

To connect Langflow to NVIDIA R2X, follow these steps.

1. In the Langflow **Playground**, click **Publish**, and then click **NVIDIA Project R2X**.

The **NVIDIA R2X** pane lists the connection values for your deployment:

* **Host name**: The default Langflow host is `127.0.0.1`.
* **Port number**: The default Langflow port is `7860`.
* **Endpoint URL**: The default address is `/api/v1/ws/flow_as_tool/FLOW_ID`.

Optionally, to generate an API key for NVIDIA R2X to connect to your server, click **Create API Key**.

3. Copy the connection values from Langflow to your NVIDIA R2X application.
Your flow is now available to your R2X avatar as a tool.
